<h1><font color=#333333>Why SoftEdge Capital?</font></h1>
<h3>The professionals at SoftEdge Capital will work with you from start to finish making sure the transaction moves ahead in a smooth and timely manner. We work with you in the following eight phases:    
    <ol align="left">
    <li>Strategy session – It’s critical to know from the start what a buyer or seller expects to accomplish. We make sure that all parties understand the desired outcome before we move to the next step.</li>
        <br>
    <li>Sourcing and identification – Finding just the right buyer or company to acquire is sometimes like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Our goal is to find good companies that meet your parameters that have not been on the market. We bring to you a small number of highly qualified buyers or companies.</li>
             <br>
    <li>Relationship management – Acquisitions and divestitures often take months to complete. We handle the relationships with the potential buyer or seller so that you can continue to focus on your business.</li>
             <br>
    <li>Deal construction and negotiations – We have been involved in hundreds of deal constructions and negotiations and bring that expertise to your transaction. Since we know your expectations, we can review all purchase proposals before submitting them to you, thus saving you time.</li>
             <br>
    <li>Due diligence – While we don’t get involved in the due diligence process, we can provide guidance, checklists and other advice.</li>
             <br>
    <li>Legal and contract review – We will work closely with your M+A attorney or suggest one that we have closely worked with. While we are not attorneys, we will review all contracts and provide you with our comments.</li>
             <br>
    <li>Close – We make sure that all of the above are done correctly and there are no hidden “deal breakers” that can stop the transaction from closing.</li>
             <br>
    <li>Transition and integration – A successful transaction requires a smooth transition and integration. If you are a buyer, we can assist you in developing a comprehensive transition and integration plan.</li>
        
    </ol>
